# iThemes Exchange - Digital Variants

Add-on for iThemes Exchange that adds the ability to sell digital variants of physical products, including enabling downloads and removing shipping.

## Motivation

While developing for an online magazine website, we wanted to offer both physical and digital versions of any given magazine in our iThemes Exchange powered online shop. Rather than making duplicate products (one Physical and one Digital) we preferred the idea of using the iThemes Exchange - Variants add-on to choose between a physical and digital version. As iThemes did not deliver this out of the box, this plugin was developed.
